# Multi app

Let's try to build an app using elm-pages AND elm-spa by merging the dist folders.

Look at each README for more details.

Commands:
- `npm run start:web`: start the dev server for the website (elm-pages)
- `npm run start:app`: start the dev server for the app (elm-spa)
- `npm run build`: build prod package, it will be in `/dist` folder
- `npm run preview`: build prod package and launch a webserver to preview it
